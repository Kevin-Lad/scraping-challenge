# scraping-challenge
Description:
This is the homework challenge for module 11 of bootcamp, which focuses on using Beautiful Soup to scrape information from websites. 

The first part of the challenge we reference the following website: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html.
The task is to scrape the titles and previews and store the information.

In the second part of the assignment, we take information from this website: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html.
Here I am tasked with scraping all of the data and compiling the information into a dataframe. Once the dataframe is complete, I analyzed
data and finally exported the dataframe to a CSV file.

Code:
A starter code was provided for both parts of teh challenge. The activites we went over in class laid the groundwork for the code. We also had a brainstorming session with our instructor. I also made use of the internet to look up syntax for a couple problem areas. One was sorting the number of months on Mars, it took me a few tries to get the sorted values how I wanted them. The second was the syntax for writing a CSV file.
